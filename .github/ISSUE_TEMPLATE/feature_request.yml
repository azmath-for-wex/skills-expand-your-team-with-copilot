      label: Technical Implementation Hints
      description: Suggestions for how this could be implemented
      placeholder: |
        Frontend suggestions:
        - Add search input and filter dropdowns to static/index.html
        - Use JavaScript to filter the activities list dynamically
        - Consider adding CSS for better styling

        Backend suggestions:
        - Modify the /activities endpoint to accept search and filter parameters
        - Add filtering logic to backend/routers/activities.py
        - Consider adding database indexes if using real database

        Files likely to be modified:
        - src/static/index.html (UI elements)
        - src/static/script.js (search functionality)
        - src/backend/routers/activities.py (API filtering)
