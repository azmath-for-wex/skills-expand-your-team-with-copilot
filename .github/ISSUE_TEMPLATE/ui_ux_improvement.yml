        Example: The current activity cards are plain text lists that are hard to scan quickly. Students have difficulty:
        - Distinguishing between different activities
        - Seeing important information like time and location at a glance
        - Understanding which activities have available spots
        - Feeling engaged with the visual presentation

        Example: Redesign activity cards to be more visually appealing and informative:
        - Use card-based layout with proper spacing and shadows
        - Add color coding for different activity types (blue for sports, green for academic, etc.)
        - Display key information prominently (time, location, spots available)
        - Add icons for different activity types
        - Show visual indicators for full/available activities
        - Improve button styling and hover effects
